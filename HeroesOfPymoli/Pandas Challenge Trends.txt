There are some trends that can be seen from the data on the purchase data for the video game. For one, when comparing genders, males appear to be the dominant user and spender, having 84% of players that made a purchase. Males overall accounted for $1,967 of sales compared to $362 for females and $50 for other/non-disclosed. Another trend shown from the data is that the 20-24 age group accounts for about 45% of players, accounting for $1,114 of sales for the game. Finally, when looking at individual item sales, a few items sold above the rest. The “Final Critic” and “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm” items sold the most, with 13 and 12 sales respectively. The “Nirvana” and “Fiery Glass Crusader” Items were shortly behind with 9 sales each. Overall, these items are the best sellers, for whatever reason, and a good marketing campaign might be advertising these items, especially targeted towards males aged 20-24.
